# Figures and Tables

This directory contains R scripts for creating the figures and tables for the paper that should result from this thesis.
For each figure/table there is an own R script, which ultimately produces the desired output, e.g. a pdf-file containing the figure or a text file with LaTeX code for the table that should be produced.
The naming convention is based a) on the table/figure numbers in my thesis document and b) a (hopefully) descriptive but concise name in addition to the figure number.
