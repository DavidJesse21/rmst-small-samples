## Overview

- restricted mean survival time (RMST) contrasts as alternative estimands to the hazard ratio (HR) for time-to-event endpoints

- two-sample comparisons under small to moderate sample sizes

- comparison of different inference methods w.r.t. controlling the type I error and CI coverage

- asymptotic and resampling-based methods


## Hazard Ratio

- hazard rate
$$
h(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0}
\frac{P(t \leq T < t + \Delta t | T \geq t)}{\Delta t}
$$

- most common effect measure: hazard ratio (HR)
$$
HR(t) = h_1(t) / h_0(t) := \theta
$$

- proportional hazards assumption

  - model-based effect measure

  - strong assumption and often violated in practice (e.g. in oncology trials)
  
- hard to interpret clinically, event if the PH assumption holds

- no causal interpretation (even not in RCTs)


## Restricted mean Survival Time (RMST)

$$
\mu(t^*) = E[min(T, t^*)] = \int_0^{t^*} S(u) \,du
$$

- expected survival within the (pre-)specified follow-up period from time $0$ to $t^*$

- circumvent the aforementioned issues with the hazard ratio

```{r}

dt = survival::veteran
setDT(dt)
dt = dt[time <= 800]

fit = survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = dt)

ggrmst(fit, cutoff = 350) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    name = "Time",
    breaks = seq(0, 800, by = 100)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Survival probability",
    breaks = seq(0, 1, by = 0.2)
  )
```


## Inference for RMST contrasts

$$
H_0: \mu_1(t^*) - \mu_0(t^*) = 0 \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_1: \mu_1(t^*) - \mu_0(t^*) \neq 0
$$

- focus on two-sample comparisons in an RCT setting

- asymptotic test based on NPMLE (Kaplan-Meier) estimator

  - inflation of type I error under small to moderate sample sizes
  
- other approaches so far

  - Horiguchi & Uno, 2020: "simple" permutation method
  
  - Ditzhaus et al., 2023: studentized permutation method
  
  - (Zhou, 2021: empirical likelihood ratio)


## Goals of my Master's Thesis

- replicate results by Ditzhaus et al., 2023

  - asymptotic test and studentized permutation test
  
- propose further existing resampling-based approaches (in the broader sense)

  - pseudo-observations + HC3 covariance matrix estimator
  
  - infinitesimal jackknife pseudo-observations + bootstrap covariance estimator
  
- PO approaches might have some advantages for further extensions

  - e.g. covariate adjustment and more general designs
  
  - (though these aspects will not be discussed in detail)
  

# Methods


## Asymptotic Test

- test statistic
$$
Z = \frac{\hat{\mu}_1(t^*) - \hat{\mu}_0(t^*)}{\sqrt{Var[\hat{\mu}_1(t^*)] + Var[\hat{\mu}_0(t^*)]}}
$$

- asymptotic distribution
$$
Z \danull N(0, 1)
$$

- statistical test
$$
\varphi^{(asy)} = \mathbf{1} \{Z > z_{1- \alpha/2} \}
$$
  - $z_{1- \alpha/2}$: $(1 - \alpha/2)$-quantile of the standard normal distribution


## Studentized Permutation Test

- relax the assumptions on the null distribution

- re-randomization of the original data by permuting the treatment indicators $B$ times

- for each permuted data set compute the test statistic
$$
Z^{\pi} =
\left| \frac{\hat{\mu}_1^{\pi}(t^*) - \hat{\mu}_0^{\pi}(t^*)}{\sqrt{Var[\hat{\mu}_1^{\pi}(t^*)] + Var[\hat{\mu}_0^{\pi}(t^*)]}} \right| 
$$

- statistical test
$$
\varphi^{\pi} = \mathbf{1} \{|Z| > q_{1 - \alpha}^{\pi} \}
$$
  - $q_{1 - \alpha}^{\pi}$: $(1 - \alpha)$-quantile of the the permutation test statistics
  

## Pseudo-Observations (1)

- pseudo-observations for estimand of interest
$$
P_i = n \hat{\theta} - (n - 1) \hat{\theta}_{-i}
$$
  - $\hat{\theta}$: marginal estimator
  
  - $\hat{\theta}_{-i}$: jackknife leave-one-out estimator
  
- use regression models on the pseudo-observations to estimate covariate/treatment effects

  - generalized estimating equations / quasi-likelihood methods
  
- use robust HC3 covariance matrix estimator


## Pseudo-Observations (2)

- infinitesimal jackknife pseudo-observations
$$
\begin{split}
  P_i &= n \hat{\theta} - (n - 1) \hat{\theta}_{-i} \\
  &= \hat{\theta} + (n - 1) (\hat{\theta} - \hat{\theta}_{-i}) \\
  &\approx \hat{\theta} + n \frac{\partial \hat{\theta}}{\partial w_i}
\end{split}
$$
  - advantage: computational speed
  
- same procedure like before but use the bootstrap for estimation of the covariance matrix


# Simulation Study


## Settings

- adapted from Ditzhaus et al., 2023

- survival models: PH (exponential), crossing (piece-wise exponential), crossing (Weibull, different shapes)

- censoring models: unequal Weibull, equal uniform, equal Weibull

- sample allocations: $(12, 18)$, $(15, 15)$, $(18, 12)$

- sample sizes: $K = 1, 2, 4, 6$

  - multiplication with base allocation
  
- RMST difference: $\Delta = 0, 1.5$ ($t^* = 10$)

- 216 settings in total with 5000 simulation replications


## Computation & Reproducibility

- `R` version `4.3.0` on the GWDG HPC cluster

- `{renv}` package for package and project management

- `{withr}` and `{parallel}` packages and L'Ecuyer-CMRG RNG for reproducible stochastic (parallel) computations

- methods mainly implemented from scratch with the following exceptions

  - code basis for studentized permutation test has been supplied by Prof. Marc Ditzhaus
  
  - PO regression models were fitted using the `{eventglm}` package


## Results

- results are consistent with those from Ditzhaus et al., 2023

- permutation test does a good job on controlling the type I error rate and achieving CI coverage close to the nominal level

- PO + HC3 covariance matrix proved to be valid alternative to the permutation test

  - only one setting more in which type I error was not controlled
  
  - slightly worse coverage in settings with very small sample sizes
  
- IJ PO + bootstrap did not perform well

  - but still better than asymptotic test
  
- power: no remarkable differences between methods

  - especially not for ranges that we would try to actually achieve in practice
  


# Summary & Outlook


## Summary

- RMST contrasts as alternative effect measures instead of hazard ratio

- inflated type I error rate for the asymptotic RMST test

- resampling-based approaches could be shown to be a remedy for this

- PO1 is a valid alternative to studentized permutation test with some potential advantages

  - computation time (maybe not so relevant for single analyses)
  
  - extensions to more general setting (covariate adjustment, other designs)
  
  
## Outlook

- PO2 did not perform well

  - used a "one-sample" bootstrap
  
  - maybe we repeat the simulations with a grouped/stratified bootstrap
    (though I am not sure if this will improve the performance)
    
- computation of POs

  - IPCW approaches, parametric POs, ...
  
- usage of POs for RMST-based analyses in more general settings

  - covariate adjustments
  
  - more general designs and/or testing problems (see e.g. preprint by Munko et. al., 2023)
